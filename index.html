        <ul>
          <li>Freddie Mercury was a <strong>British singer and songwriter</strong>, who achieved worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of the rock band <strong>Queen.</strong></li>
          <li>Regarded as <strong>one of the greatest singers in the history of rock music</strong>, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave vocal range. </li>
          <li>Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.</li>
          <li>Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor.</li>
          <li>Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "<em>Killer Queen</em>", "<em>Bohemian Rhapsody</em>", "<em>Somebody to Love</em>", "<em>We Are the Champions</em>", "<em>Don't Stop Me Now</em>" and "<em>Crazy Little Thing Called Love</em>".</li>
          <li>Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with Queen, and posthumously featured on their album, Made in Heaven (1995). He announced his diagnosis the day before his death, from complications from the disease, in 1991 at the age of 45.</li>
          <li>In 1992, a concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of AIDS awareness. His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018 biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.</li>
